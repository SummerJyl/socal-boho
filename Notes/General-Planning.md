1. Drafting Copy to Integrate Your Social Media Content
Here’s a versatile starter draft you can customize for a “Social Highlights” or “From My Socials” section on your site:

Example Section Intro Copy:

From My Socials

Follow along on my socials to stay inspired and connected!

For embedding or showcasing specific posts:

2. Hosting Your Blog on GitHub Pages vs WordPress
GitHub Pages

Great if you want full control over your code, lightweight static sites, and free hosting.

Perfect for HTML/CSS/JS/VSC workflow.

Limited to static sites (no PHP backend).

You can integrate dynamic features using client-side JS or APIs.

WordPress

Easier for content management with lots of built-in tools, plugins, and themes.

Great for non-coders or sites needing frequent updates with a CMS.

More server resource heavy, usually requires paid hosting unless you use WordPress.com free tier with limitations.

Less direct control over code compared to GitHub + VSC.

Recommendation:
Since you like coding in VSC and want control, GitHub Pages is a solid choice for your blog and portfolio site — especially if you keep it mostly static with some JS enhancements. For blogging, you can use tools like:

Static Site Generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy) — generate blog posts from Markdown files, deploy on GitHub Pages.

Headless CMS options (Netlify CMS, Contentful, Sanity) — manage content visually, but still build static sites with VSC.
